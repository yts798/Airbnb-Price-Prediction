# Airbnb Price Prediction Using XGBoost, DNN, and Self-Attention Models

This repository contains a comprehensive project aimed at predicting Airbnb listing prices using advanced machine learning models, including XGBoost, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and a Lightweight Self-Attention Neural Network. The project leverages a rich dataset of Airbnb listings, applying cutting-edge techniques to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict Airbnb prices based on a variety of listing features, such as location, amenities, room type, and more. We approach this challenge by employing three distinct models:

- **XGBoost:** A gradient boosting framework that uses decision trees and ensemble techniques for high performance and speed.
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN):** A sophisticated neural network with multiple layers, ReLU activation, dropout regularization, and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and ensure robust performance.
- **Lightweight Self-Attention Neural Network:** An innovative model that utilizes self-attention and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms to dynamically focus on the most relevant features for prediction, tailored for tabular data like Airbnb listings.

## Features

- Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand underlying patterns and distributions within the Airbnb dataset.
- Comprehensive preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for modeling, including encoding categorical variables and normalizing features.
- Implementation of XGBoost, DNN, and Self-Attention models with fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score, across both training and testing sets.
- Comparison of model performances to identify the most effective approach for Airbnb price prediction.
